Goal: developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow for better education of the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet

## Earthquake Visualization

I imported and visualized the data by doing the following:

- Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from my dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- My data markers  reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes  appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

- I included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

- I created a legend that will provide context for your map data.
